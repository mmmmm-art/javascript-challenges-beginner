/*
 Challenge 1: Print all even numbers from 0 â€“ 10
    
    Try to make the solution to this problem as efficiently as possible. 
    Consider using loops that would allow you to type the fewest characters/commands. 
    While you could simply print the even numbers, get creative and see how you could 
    output them in a way that would work up to 10 or even up to 10,000 with little 
    extra effort.
 */

// you can log out to the console or to the output container like this:
// output.innerText = "My output";
const output = document.getElementById("output-container");
if (!output) throw "Output container not found.";

//@ts-check
// your code starts after this line

let num = 0;
let nums = [];

function animate() {
	nums.push(num);
	num += 2;

	output.innerText = nums;
	requestAnimationFrame(animate);
}

requestAnimationFrame(animate);

//solved
